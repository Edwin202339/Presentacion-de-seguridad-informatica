# Copilot Instructions for AI Coding Agents

This codebase currently has no files or documentation. To be immediately productive, follow these guidelines:

## Project Overview
- The workspace is empty. No source code, configuration files, or documentation are present.
- No build, test, or run workflows are defined yet.
- No project-specific conventions, patterns, or external dependencies are discoverable.

## Getting Started
- Before contributing, clarify the intended architecture, major components, and development workflows with the project owner.
- Once files are added, update this document to reflect:
  - Key directories and their purpose
  - Build/test/debug commands
  - Integration points and external dependencies
  - Project-specific conventions and patterns

## Next Steps
- As the project evolves, merge new instructions here to guide future AI agents.
- Reference this file for onboarding and automation tasks.

*Update this file as soon as code or documentation is added to the workspace.*
